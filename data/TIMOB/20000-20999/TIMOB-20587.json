					"body": "[~sliang] Hi ,unfortunately we cannot size the webView based on remote data. The webView  requires the view container to be sized depending on the children within it, which we do not have in this case. I've been investigating this issue for some time and found some implementations that would size the webView depending on the remote content. However they would override a lot of our layout code and are not the best practice.  Also just like Kiat mentioned you should not have a webView inside a scrollView as it can cause native issues its actually mentioned inside apples [docs|https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIWebView_Class/]. A workaround solution would be to use a clean source for the remote data and set the webView to vertical. ",

					"body": "I will sum this up: A WebView displays HTML content. Using Ti.UI.FILL (default) for the width and height displays the WebView container and it's content. The thing is, that the WebView doesn't know about the inner-sizing of the HTML, so if you set a height/width to TiUI.SIZE, it won't be able (natively) to determine the size of the DOM that can change even after the page is loaded. That's why WebViews should not be used for sizable content because of it's layout restrictions. \r\n\r\nClean source thereby means, that developers should for example use a JSON-based API and display the data inside a ListView and/or vertical layout. So using a WebView within a ScrollView isn't good practice and not recommended by Apple as well. Although I'm wondering why it worked in iOS 8, I'm guess it doesn't because Apple simply didn't support it anymore.\r\n\r\nBecause we want to solve this anyway, here are some attempts how the issue could be handled:\r\na) Deliver the data using a clean API and display it in native elements (of course it requires data changes, but should be discussed in long-term)\r\nb) Parse the DOM and create native labels from it inside a vertical layout (fallback for a)) \r\nc) Move the content to an own page using a \"read more\" button and present it fullscreen there. Use another static-height webview to display the preview, so the scrollView won't be needed anymore. (workaround)",
