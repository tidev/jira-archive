iOS Issues
  !  Unable to find any valid iOS distribution provisioning profiles.
     This will prevent you from packaging apps for AppStore distribution.
     You will need to log in to <a href="http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs</a> with your Apple Developer
     account, then create, download, and install a profile.



I have the certificates already installed and able to run an app on the phone using XCode.

   [~isener], I moved this issue to TIMOB project as it is not a TIDOC bug.</li>

   The error is an Xcode error, no Titanium one:
   {quote}
    Provisioning profile "generic" doesn't include signing certificate "iPhone Developer: Ilay Sener (QT9JARYJ64)".
   {quote}
   It basically means that your provisioning profile is not signed for the your developer account. You need to invalidate it via the iOS dev-portal and re-assign it to your developer certificate. Ensure that you have the private key of the account in your keychain.
   
   *EDIT*: And it might work via Xcode because it will select a managed certificate by default.
   *EDIT 2*: You state that you use the "SDK 6.2.1" which does not exist. Either 6.0.4 (latest GA), 6.1.0 (latest pre-release / RC) or 6.2.0 (master).</li>
<li>ILAY SENER 2017-05-26

   Hi Guys,
   
   The reason why this wasn't working is simply because I had multiple profiles and wasn't able to select the profile to run the app on the device.
   
   After a little research, I have found a way to delete the other profiles, which I am not able to from Studio. Then it was all fine.
   
   Perhaps, it would be a good idea to enable which profile to use to run the app when testing on the device.</li>
